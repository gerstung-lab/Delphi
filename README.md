## Repository Overview

This repository contains the code for Delphi, the modified GPT-2 model used in the paper "Learning the natural history of human disease with generative transformers", along with the training code and analysis notebooks.

The implementation is based on Andrej Karpathy's [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT).

## Installation

1. Download the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gerstung-lab/Delphi.git
cd Delphi
```

2. Create a virtual conda environment and install the requirements:
```bash
conda create -n delphi python=3.11
conda activate delphi
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Installing the requirements normally takes a few minutes.

## Data availability

Delphi-2M is trained on 400K patient health trajectories from the UK Biobank data, which is available to researchers upon [application](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/). In addition, we provide a minimal synthetic dataset that was generated by the trained model itself. The synthetic data is broadly statistically similar to the real data, while not disclosing any patient information; however this data and model is for coding testing purposes only and we absolutely do not recommend using this model for any type of research - instead, we recommend applying for the full model from the UK BioBank.


## Data preparation

To convert raw UK Biobank data into the format required for training, please refer to the `data/ukb_simulated_data/example_ukb_to_bin.ipynb` file.

If you are interested in using your own data, please refer to the `data/README.md` file for the details on how to transform it into a Delphi-compatible format.

The synthetic dataset that is available in the `data/ukb_simulated_data/` is already in the desired format and can be used for the model training demo. 

## Training

To train the model, run:

```bash
python train.py config/train_delphi_demo.py --device=cuda --out_dir=Delphi-2M
```

If you want to train the model on a CPU, remove the `--device=cuda` argument.
For more information on the training configuration, check the `config/train_delphi_demo.py` file.

Training a demo model takes around 10 minutes on a single GPU.

Training the original model took 1 GPU-hour (NVIDIA V100, CentOS 7). Training on M1 Macbook Pro's MPS takes around 10 hours.

## Docker

We provide a Dockerfile to run the training and downstream analyses. Please refer to the `containers/Dockerfile` for the details.

## Notebooks

After training the model, the obtained checkpoints can be used to run the analysis notebooks.
Please note that in order to reproduce the results from the paper, it is necessary to train the model on the UK Biobank data. 

There are the following notebooks in the root folder:

`evaluate_delphi.ipynb`: The notebook is used to evaluate Delphi-2M in terms of prediction accuracy compared to age-sex-based epidemiological baseline and calibration of the predicted risks. Furthermore, it explores the attention mechanism of the model and the structure of the latent space using UMAP of the learned disease embeddings.

`shap_analysis.ipynb`: The notebook is used to analyse the SHAP values of the model to understand the importance of the input disease events for the model's predictions for a given patient. Then, using SHAP values aggregated over the entire dataset, we identify the diseases that are most important for each possible disease in the future.

`sampling_trajectories.ipynb`: The notebook is used to analyse the synthetic data generated by Delphi-2M. It compares the synthetic data to the real data in terms of the distribution of disease events, ages and disease rates.

`data/ukb_simulated_data/example_ukb_to_bin.ipynb`: The notebook is used to convert the raw UK Biobank data into the format required for training.

## FastAPI Service for Delphi

A simple FastAPI service is provided to allow inference and model stats via HTTP endpoints.

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Edit `config.yaml` to specify the checkpoint path and device:
   ```yaml
   ckpt_path: "Delphi-2M/ckpt.pt"
   device: "cpu"
   dtype: "float32"
   ```

3. Start the service:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app:app --reload
   ```

### Endpoints

- `POST /extrapolate_trajectory`  
  Extrapolates a partial health trajectory. The POST body should be a JSON array of events:
  ```json
  [
    {"event": "Male", "age": 0},
    {"event": "B01 Varicella [chickenpox]", "age": 2},
    ...
  ]
  ```
  Returns the extrapolated trajectory as a list of events and ages.

- `GET /model_stats`  
  Returns the model arguments from the checkpoint (same as `checkpoint['model_args']`).

API documentation is available at `/docs` when running the service.
