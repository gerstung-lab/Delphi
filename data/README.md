# Data Preparation

Multimodal Delphi (Delphi-M4) handles data differently compared to the original version. The data directory should be structured as follows:

```bash
# file tree of example data directory
ukb_data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data.bin
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ time.bin
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ p2i.csv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tokenizer.yaml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ participants/ # participant ID lists
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train_fold.bin
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ val_fold.bin
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ expansion_packs/ # additional discrete modalities that expand upon the original vocab of disease events (e.g. surgical operations)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ops/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data.bin
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ time.bin
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ p2i.csv
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tokenizer.yaml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ biomarkers/ # biomarker modalties (e.g. polygenic risk scores and blood panels)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prs/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data.bin
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ p2i.csv
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ blood/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data.bin
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ p2i.csv
```

## Event Records

Event records represent disease occurrences with sex and lifestyle tokens that the original Delphi was trained on.

> **Tipüí°:** In the first version of Delphi, data is stored on a binary file `data.bin` that consists of three columns: participant IDs, timesteps, and tokens. And a mapping from participant IDs to starting positions and sequence lengths is dynamically constructed. In Delphi-M4, we essentially decompose that binary file into two separate files: tokens (`data.bin`) and timesteps (`time.bin`). And the mapping (`p2i.csv`) is constructed beforehand.

- **`data.bin`**
  - Contains a contiguous sequence of all event tokens (`np.uint32`)
  - **Important‚ùó:** Token indexing starts at 2. See below for a more detailed explanation.
- **`time.bin`**
  - Contains a contiguous sequence of timestamps measured in days (`np.uint32`)
  - Timestamps correspond to when event tokens occurred
  - Must map one-to-one with `data.bin` entries and be exactly the same length
- **`p2i.csv`**
  - Contains three columns: `pid`, `start_pos`, and `seq_len`
  - Maps each participant ID (`pid`) to:
    - `start_pos`: starting index in the data files
    - `seq_len`: sequence length for that participant
- **`tokenizer.yaml`**
  - Dictionary mapping event names to token indices. Refer to `data/ukb_real_data/tokenizer.yaml` for an example.
  - Must include these required mappings:

    ```yaml
    padding: 0
    no_event: 1
    ```

> **Important‚ùó:** `padding`(0) is a placeholder token and `no_event` (1) is only introduced into the trajectories during training as data augmentation. Neither `padding` nor `no_event` are present in the data itself. Hence, the smallest token in `data.bin` should be 2, which corresponds to `female`.

## Data Split

To split your data into training and validation folds, create two lists of participant IDs (`np.uint32`) (one for training and one for validation), and save them to `./participants/train_fold.bin` and `./participants/val_fold.bin`. The naming here is flexible as long as they are consistent with how they are referenced in the training config. You can create as many participant lists as your analysis requires.

## Multimodal Extensions

Multimodal data can be incorporated in two ways: as biomarkers or expansion packs.

### Biomarkers

A biomarker represents a measurement taken at a specific time point in an individual's health trajectory. Examples include HbA1c levels, polygenic risk scores, and diet quality indices.

- **`data.bin`**
  - One-dimensional, contiguous array containing biomarker measurements (`np.float32`)
- **`p2i.csv`**
  - Contains four columns: `pid`, `visit`, `start_pos`, and `seq_len`
  - Maps each participant ID (`pid`) to:
    - `visit`: An integer index representing the chronological order of a biomarker measurement within a participant's timeline. For a given individual (pid), the first recorded measurement is assigned visit = 0, the second visit = 1, and so on. This index captures the relative sequence of measurements within subjects, independent of absolute time.
    - `start_pos`: The starting index in data.bin where the biomarker sequence for a given participant and visit begins. This index allows you to locate the first value of the participant's biomarker data in the one-dimensional array. Combined with seq_len, it defines the contiguous slice of data corresponding to that specific measurement.
    - `seq_len`: Number of measurements (e.g., 36 for polygenic risk scores covering 36 diseases)
    - `time`: Timestamp in days when the biomarker was measured

#### Registering a New Biomarker

Delphi includes a modality embedding layer that learns embeddings for each biomarker. To introduce a new biomarker, you must first register it in the system.

**Steps to register a new biomarker:**

1. **Update the Modality enum** - Navigate to `delphi/multimodal.py` and locate the `Modality` class:

    ```python
    class Modality(Enum):
        # 0 for padding; 1 for event tokens
        PRS = 2
        FAMILY_HX = 3
        BLOOD_ALL = 4
        WBC = 5
        LIPID = 6
        LFT = 7
        RENAL = 8
        HBA1C = 9
        CRP = 10
        URATE = 11
        CYSC = 12
        APO = 13
        VITD = 14
        DHT = 15
        SHBG = 16
        IGF1 = 17
        NAK = 18
        CREAT = 19
        ALBU = 20
        MEDS = 21
        DIET = 22
        MET = 23
        TELOMERE = 24
        # SLEEP_SCORE = 25
    ```

2. **Add your biomarker** - Append your new biomarker to the end of the enum with the next sequential index. For example, to add `SLEEP_SCORE`:
   - Use the next available index (current highest + 1)
   - Follow the existing naming convention (uppercase with underscores)

3. **Create matching directory** - The data directory name must match the enum name in lowercase. For `SLEEP_SCORE`, create a directory named `sleep_score` under `biomarkers`.

**Example:**
If adding a sleep quality biomarker, add `SLEEP_SCORE = 25` to the enum and create a `sleep_score/` directory containing the required files.

### Expansion Packs

An expansion pack contains additional timestamped events that enrich an individual's health trajectory. Examples include surgical operations and medical prescriptions that extend beyond Delphi's original disease occurrence vocabulary.

- **`data.npy`**
  - One-dimensional, contiguous array of all tokens (`np.uint32`)
  - **Important‚ùó:** Token indexing starts at 1
- **`time.npy`**
  - One-dimensional, contiguous array of timestamps in days (`np.uint32`)
  - Corresponds to when event tokens occurred
- **`p2i.csv`**
  - Maps each participant ID (`pid`) to:
    - `start_pos`: starting index in both `data.npy` and `time.npy`
    - `seq_len`: sequence length for that participant
- **`tokenizer.yaml`**
  - Dictionary mapping event names (surgical operations, medications, etc.) to token indices. For example,

    ```yaml
    heart_surgery: 1
    coronary_angioplasty_(ptca)_+/-_stent: 2
    other_arterial_surgery/revascularisation_procedures: 3
    coronary_artery_bypass_grafts_(cabg): 4
    pacemaker/defibrillator_insertion: 5
    ```

  - Token indexing must be consistent with `data.npy` and starts at 1

### Tests üíØ

Once you have processed the data, check that it is done correctly by running the following tests:

```bash
# event records
pytest delphi/test/test_data.py --dataset $NAME_OF_YOUR_DATASET
# biomarkers
pytest delphi/test/test_biomarkers.py --dataset $NAME_OF_YOUR_DATASET
# expansion packs
pytest delphi/test/test_expansion_packs.py --dataset $NAME_OF_YOUR_DATASET
```

Ensure that all tests are passed before moving on training your model.
